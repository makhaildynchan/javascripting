// A string is a sequence of characters. A character is, roughly speaking, a
//   written symbol. Examples of characters are letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and spaces.

//   String values are surrounded by either single or double quotation marks.

//      'this is a string'

//      "this is also a string"

//  ## NOTE

//   Try to stay consistent. In this workshop we'll only use single quotation marks.

//  ## The challenge:

//   For this challenge, create a file named strings.js.

//   In that file create a variable named someString like this:

//      const someString = 'this is a string'

//   Use console.log to print the variable someString to the terminal.

const someString = 'this is a string'
console.log(someString)
